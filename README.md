=======

An unofficial [Douban][douban] app mainly used for browsing the [Groups][douban-groups] section.
\([Ë±ÜÁì£][douban]ÈùûÂÆòÊñπappÔºå‰∏ªË¶ÅÁî®‰∫é[Â∞èÁªÑ][douban-groups]ÊµèËßà„ÄÇ\)

The development of this app will soon been restarted but still not progressed on a frequent basis, as is requested by the friend who filed the first issue! While we will only develop for the only user, this project is also going to be used as the playground for new libraries such as Jetpack Compose, partially serving the development of MinusOne Music and helping me understand declarative programming.

It has been inactive for 8 months, as:

* Reinforced by the org/mods, Douban users are making hilarious remarks, which are frustrating to read
* There are few alternatives for me to refer to
* Group theming is currently a mess

Note I am an inexperienced Android beginner and the only developer of it. Occasional crashes may happen, UI design may be incomplete and features you need may be
missing. Pretty much of my work is copy and paste from the official documentation and samples of Google Android. I am trying my best only to ensure that the app will function normally on my Xiaomi devices with the Android version varying from 8.1 to 12.

### Getting Started

This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the `gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

#### Douban access

To not get myself into trouble, I have added detailed implementation of data access to .gitignore list. However, the latest release is always available.

### Who is it for?

* Me and other developers who are learning Android, Kotlin and version control
* Me and other users who want easier access to Douban groups module

### Features

It not only implements the very basic features of Douban app, but also has its own features. Some of which react to the fact that Douban community is somewhat unfriendly and closed to non-members;
examples are power abuse of some group mods, "apply ~~to follow or~~ to talk" and etc.

\* In more recent (after mid-2022) versions of the Douban app, the feature of following unjoined groups is finally added by them.

* Inherent advantages leading to good performance and simple coding

      and
      tabs\)

* \[GroupDetailFragment\] The problem that if the initial position is manually set, the last
  position won't be restored when the pager is being recreated is solved, but not in a way that is
  clean enough
  * Should I use Fragment.isResumed?

* üõ† Views on top of WebView become invisible after scroll on my MIUI 10 Android 8.1 device \(causes
  unknown, may never be fixed\)

Anecdotes

### Efforts to Solve the dynamic ViewPager2 problem

The problem is that when an ViewPager2 is asynchronously loaded via its FragmentStateAdapter from a LiveData containing info of its tabs \(pages\), either the pager position or the page position will never be saved, unlike the behavior of a RecycleView with its customized ListAdapter. LiveData +
ViewPager2 seemed to be a very unpopular combination, and there is little info about it online.
Hence, the issue had obsessed me for months and discouraged me to continue the development. On April
10th in 2023, I decided to have my last fight against it. What I did:

1. Download Douban APK version 6.40.0 \(less obscuration, faster decompilation\)
2. Decompile it via JADX-GUI and export it to gradle project
3. Open the project in Android Studio and research on what the Douban implementation is. \(Brief
   conclusion: GroupDetailActivity + FragmentStatePagerAdapter + Intent/Bundle\)

I repeated these steps on version 7 & 8, only to find that the ugly and lengthy code is still almost unchanged. It really surprised me. In early July, after weeks of architecture optimization, I solved it by attaching adapter only when data is ready, and used an Event wrapper to set the default position \(which would soon be replaced by a Coroutine method\) .
