An unofficial [Douban][douban] app mainly used for browsing the [Groups][douban-groups] section. Subjects module is under construction.

### Getting Started

### Using this app

- [Latest release][latest-elease]
- Supported Android versions: 8.1 - 14 (and virtually 15)
- Feel free to file issues
  - If certain data doesn‚Äôt display, it‚Äôs likely due to a JSON parsing error. Including details like the content title, related URLs (obtained from the Douban app), or raw JSON responses (if possible) in your issue can help resolve the issue faster.
- It's recommended to keep the Douban app coexist
  - Support the official product
  - Some content is missing in doubean
  - Especially for [rooted users](#reuse-login-session)
- Occasionally, you may need to manually clear app data after installation if I forget to handle ROOM database schema changes properly.

### Why isn‚Äôt it open-source?

To avoid potential issues, pushing the source code (not the release APKs) to the public repository has been suspended. However, if you‚Äôre interested in non-sensitive parts of the code, I may consider sharing them upon request.

### Your do's and don'ts

- **Do:** Use this app only for personal learning purposes.
- **Don‚Äôt:** Share it on other websites or apps without permission.
