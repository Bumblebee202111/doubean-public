doubean
=======

An unofficial [Douban][douban] app mainly used for browsing the [Groups][douban-groups] section.
\([豆瓣][douban]非官方app，主要用于[小组][douban-groups]浏览。\)

The development of this app is restarted to meet the requirements the friend who filed the first issue! While we will only develop for them, this project is also going to be used as the playground for fashionable libraries/coding styles such as Jetpack Compose, partially serving the development of MinusOne Music and helping me understand declarative programming. This brings [tons of migration tasks](#migrations), and also means that old libraries and new libraries are currently mixed together.

It has been inactive for 8 months, as:
* Reinforced by the org/mods, hilarious remarks can be found everywhere
* There are few other alternatives for me to refer to
* Group theming is currently a mess

Note I am an inexperienced Android beginner and the only developer of it. Occasional crashes may happen, UI design may be incomplete and features you need may be
missing. Pretty much of my work is copy and paste from the official documentation and samples of Google Android. I am trying my best only to ensure that the app will function normally on my Xiaomi devices with the Android version varying from 8.1 to 12 and the user's device.

**Very important changes starting from 0.5.0:**

* Repo name: `doubean` -> `doubean-public`
  - New code will only be pushed into the private `doubean`
* New package name: com.github.bumblebee202111.doubean`

To not get this project/myself into trouble, the update of the source code of the public repo will be suspended. However, the latest release is always available.

### Who is it for?

* Me and other developers who are learning Android, Kotlin and version control
* Me and other users who want easier access to Douban groups module

### Your do's and don'ts

- Please use it only for personal learning purposes. 
- Please don't share it on other websites/apps without permission.
