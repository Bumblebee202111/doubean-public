doubean
=======

An unofficial [Douban][douban] app mainly used for browsing the [Groups][douban-groups] section. Subjects development is just started.
\([Ë±ÜÁì£][douban]ÈùûÂÆòÊñπappÔºå‰∏ªË¶ÅÁî®‰∫é[Â∞èÁªÑ][douban-groups]ÊµèËßà„ÄÇ‰π¶ÂΩ±~~Èü≥~~ÂºÄÂèëÊâçÂàöÂàöÂºÄÂßã„ÄÇ\)

Note: This personal project implements some essential features as well as user requested ones which are practical. It is also going to be used as my playground for trending technologies such as Jetpack Compose. Occasional crashes may happen, UI design may be incomplete and features you need may be missing.

**Known issues:**

- The last vertical scroll position of selected tab in Group Detail Screen is always lost (reset) when returned from Topic Detail Screen, since Navigation Compose migration, v0.6.3(603).

### Getting Started

### Using this app

- Supported Android versions: 8.1 - 14 (and 15, realistically)
- Sometimes you need to manually clear app data after installation when I forget to handle ROOM database schema change
- Feel free to file issues
  - Specifically, if some data doesn't show, a JSON parsing error probably occurs. The raw JSON response (if possible) or related share urls from Douban might help solve it  
- It's recommended to make the Douban app coexist
  - Please support the official product
  - Lots of content is missing in doubean
  - Especially for [rooted users](#reuse-login-session)

### Open-source?

To not get this project/myself into trouble, the update of the source code in the public repo has been suspended. However, the [latest release][latest-elease] is always available, and I'm willing to share the part of the code that you are interested in if it does not qinquan that much.

### Your do's and don'ts

- Please use it only for personal learning purposes. 
- Please don't share it on other websites/apps without permission.

### Features

  * Inspired by Ë±ÜÁì£ËØÑÂàÜ mini program on which parts to omit

  * Favorite tabs/groups locally

* Ad-free, lite \(~4MB\)
* <span id="reuse-login-session"> While phone login is blocked by complicated and tight authentication, rooted users can reuse login session of Douban app </span>

* Partial offline caching support in Groups
* Very basic Statuses tab (no longer updated)
* Partial support for viewing content in Douban WebView optimized for mobile reading in case of need (no longer updated)

### Plans

Incoming features, bug fixes, libraries to use and environment changes \(roughly in chronological order\)

#### To-dos for current release \(0.7.8\)

#### To-dos for next release \(0.7.9)


#### Future plans

* Gradual migrations:
  * From MD2 / custom design to MD3
  * From View and Data Binding to Jetpack Compose
    * Exceptions: WebView/RatingBar/PreferenceFragmentCompat/CollapsingToolbarLayout/Spinner
  * Gracefully remove Fragments: First reduce usages of Fragment methods
* Subjects (‰π¶ÂΩ±Èü≥)
  * Show type label in multi-type subject list

  * Interest buttons
    * Maybe choose tonal style instead
  * Tweak reviews sheet
  * More details & sub-features

### Stars :star: & Donation :coffee:

I'm totally aware that this app is mediocre. However, the increasing number of stars keep me motivated! Thank you!

If you find it really useful and would like to buy me a coffee, which I am not ready for, please contact me by creating an issue.
