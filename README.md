An unofficial [Douban][douban] app focused on browsing [Groups][douban-groups] and exploring Subjects  (books/movies/TV). The Subjects module is under construction.

### Getting Started

### Using this app

- [Latest release][latest-release]
- Android: 8.1‚Äì14 (and virtually 15)
- Feel free to file issues
  - Include details if data fails to display (common causes: JSON parsing errors):
    - Titles and related URLs (from Douban app)
    - Raw JSON (if accessible).
- Keep the official Douban app installed:
  - Support the official product
  - Access content unavailable in doubean
  - Essential for [rooted users](#reuse-login-session)
- Clear app data manually after updates if the app crashes (possibly due to failed Room database migrations)

### Plans

Incoming features, bug fixes, libraries to use and environment changes \(roughly in chronological order\). Primarily for myself.

#### Current release \(0.7.17\)

#### Next release \(0.7.18)


#### Future plans

* Another attempt to implement p/p login

  * If fails, allow non rooted users (guests) to browse their subjects/groups if a user ID is provided

* Subjects

  * Colors
  * More details & sub-features

* Remember last active bottom navigation/Subjects tabs

* Groups
  * Dynamic topic sorts-by

  - Re-evaluate ROOM caching (complexity reduction)
    - Isolate cache/fresh logic in repository layer
    - Only save the shared fields of simple/detail models
    - Make detail UI states use both models 

  - Tweak component colors for group-themed screens

  * Home
    * Maybe support pagination of recommended topics
  * Subscribe/favorite/save
    * Save topics
    * Pin my groups
    * Add corresponding item actions
  * Group tab: Track topic read status
  * Search
    * Search topics within a specific group/tab
    * Global topic search across all groups
  * Use the new nullable "edit_time" property of network topics
  * Revert naming conventions to match Douban's standards
  * Group Detail

    * Collapse on entrance for the subscribed/favorited group/tab
    * Fix group description action overflows
  * Fix topic content losing scroll position after navigating back
  * Fix notification taps not working when app is active
  * Hide officially-flagged unfriendly content by default
  * Support blocking unwanted content
  * Lists: Reddit-style item expand/collapse
  * Find API for all followed topics (currently unlikely)

* Expand/collapse component: Hide action for short text

* Search suggestions

* Shortcuts

* Properly show login prompts & normal tooltips/info

* Error handling

  * Process error body
  * Show error messages
